<h1 align="center"> <u>Welcome to Spring!</u></h1>
<p> April showers bring mayflowers! Here in spring, it's all about pastels, flowers, and all thing bea-YOUtiful. Spring has some of the prettiest styles, and you'll surely find some sort of inspiration! Let's get glam! </p>
<h2 align="center"> Dresses</h2>
<p>For spring you literally can wear almost any style because spring is just that awesome. I like florals, plaids, and solids. For spring, the most flattering color palette is pastels. Mini, lacy, floral,and satin dresses are my favorite <p>

<h2 align="center"> Bottoms</h2>
<p> Cargo pants and jeans are great! Paper bag pants and shorts look super trendy. You can had a bandana and chain for a good add-on. Any type of skirt is cute. Honestly, in spring, any bottom is a cute one!  < /p>

<h2 align="center"> Tops</h2>
<p> Same as above, literally anything! For styles and trends however,pastels, poofy blouses, and simple tanks look great</p>


<h2 align="center"> Shoes</h2>
<p> Finally, SHOES the statement piece of all outfits. You honestly can't go wrong with these! I like a good statement kitten heel, or flat sandal. Birkenstock and Lulus have great choices. </p>
